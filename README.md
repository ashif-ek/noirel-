## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### State Management
We use a centralized Context architecture optimized for performance:
*   **CartContext**: Handles add/remove/update operations with optimistic updates and automatic rollback on error.
*   **OrderContext**: Manages checkout flows, exchange rate caching, and payment processing.

### Error Handling
*   **Global Error Boundary**: Catches unhandled exceptions in the component tree to prevent white-screen crashes.
*   **Graceful Fallbacks**: UI components handle loading and error states locally.
